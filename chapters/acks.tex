  \addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Acknowledgements}

A chain of unexpected events and some unexpected people around the world brought me here. I wouldn't be writing this page if my supervisors, Dr. B. Bonatto and Dr. M. Coutinho hadn't accepted me as their student. I kindly thank them for their endless patience with my hyperactive behaviour towards science. They were the best people to deal with the unusual ideas I proposed during these two years as a MSc student.
\\

I also thank our University, UNIFEI, for being there all the time, during my bachelor's and during my graduate studies. In times when truths and tautologies are threatened, resisting to ignorance is a brave act.
\\

Last but not least, I wouldn't have gone far if my two best friends, A. A. and A. A. (what a coincidence for these abbreviations!) hadn't been supporting me for the last decade or so. And most importantly, to my family, V. R and I. R.
